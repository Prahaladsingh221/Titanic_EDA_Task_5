# Titanic EDA - Task 5 (Data Analyst Internship)

This project is part of Task 5 of a Data Analyst Internship, focusing on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to extract insights, identify patterns, and visualize relationships that influenced passenger survival using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## Objective

To analyze the Titanic dataset and:
- Understand the distribution and types of data.
- Handle missing values.
- Create visualizations to identify patterns and correlations.
- Summarize findings and generate insights.

---

## Tools Used

- **Google Colab** – for interactive coding
- **Python** – programming language
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

## Summary of Analysis

- Majority of passengers were aged between 20–40 years.
- Male passengers outnumbered females, but females had higher survival rates.
- 1st class passengers had a significantly better chance of survival.
- Fare and Pclass showed correlation with survival.
- Missing values in "Age" and "Embarked" were handled using median and mode respectively.
- Visual tools like histograms, boxplots, countplots, heatmaps, and pairplots were used to explore data.

## Key Visualizations

- Age distribution histogram
- Gender and survival countplots
- Correlation heatmap
- Pairplot of important numerical features

## Outcome

This project improved practical skills in:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Visualization techniques
- Communicating insights from data
